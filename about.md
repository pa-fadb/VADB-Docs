# VADB

[VADB](https://fadb.live/) aims to be a resource to level creators to see the [Artist](/definitions/artist/)'s [availability](#), whether that be available or otherwise,
there will be no other bloat to the website as providing this information is the first and foremost focus, as such there's no such thing as "Accounts".

## How artists are managed

[Artists](/definitions/artist/) are carefully reviewed and managed by [Admins](#), they have the ability to change the [status](#), [availability](#), avatar, banner, description, etc.
