# Admins

Admins are a nieche concept withing [VADB](https://fadb.live/), since there's technically no user base for the site, admins are determined by a [token](#token).
Admins are responsible for adding, editing, and removing [artists](/definitions/artist#artist), as well as managing the usage rights of [artists](/definitions/artist#artist).

## Token

Tokens are given by the owner of the website and can be used by the [login endpoint](/api/login). This endpoint stores the token in the session and redirects the user to the homepage.
Tokens can only be generated by the owner of the website, there's no logic in the website to generate a token for a user. This token is then stored in the database and can be revoked by the owner if they so choose.

## Admin page

Admins have access to a dashboard where they can create, manage, and delete [Artists](/definitions/artist#artist).

### 1 - Artist row

Artists are displayed in a row with their [name](artist#properties), [status](artist#status), [tracks](artist#properties), [availability](artist#availability), and [usage rights](artist#usage-rights).

### 2 - Actions

Two buttons are displayed on the right side of the row. The first button is a button that opens a separate page where the admin can edit the [artist](/definitions/artist#artist).
The second button is a button that opens up a modal that asks the admin if they are sure they want to delete the [artist](/definitions/artist#artist).

### 3 - Create artist

This button is displayed on the top right of the page. It opens a separate page similar to the [artist](/definitions/artist#artist) edit page, but it is used to create a new [artist](/definitions/artist#artist).
